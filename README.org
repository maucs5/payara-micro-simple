* DigitalOcean + Payara Micro

The reason for this repo is to test out Domain Data Grid on DigitalOcean, although it can be tested on other
platforms, and with other workflows (like Packer, which I intend to try eventually)

* Prerequisite

Java 8 and Maven is installed

If the server doesn't have enough memory to build it, download it

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  curl -L http://central.maven.org/maven2/fish/payara/extras/payara-micro/5.191/payara-micro-5.191.jar > payara.jar
#+END_SRC

* Run

Default port is 8080

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  mvn clean install
  java -jar final-microbundle.jar
  # java -jar final-microbundle.jar --port 5000
#+END_SRC
